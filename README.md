This is the final coursework for one of my master's study at KDIS (R Fundamentals for Public Policy). The coursework is about perceptions of Korean individuals regarding marital life and partner selection. I have investigated the diverse responses that different socioeconomic backgrounds may have in response to these shifts in values. I've analyzed cross-sectional data for 6-year datasets (2006, 2008, 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022) with 22,887 observations.<br>
The subject was chosen considering serious aging population crisis in South Korea ('demographic cliff'), which has been one of the most important issues to be addressed in public policy in Korea <br>
